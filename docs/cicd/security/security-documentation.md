# CI/CD Security Documentation

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The StudyBuddy CI/CD pipeline implements defense-in-depth security principles to protect code, infrastructure, and deployment processes. This documentation covers security policies, threat models, and implementation details.

## 🎯 Security Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Code Integrity**: Ensure code authenticity and prevent tampering
- **Supply Chain Security**: Protect against compromised dependencies
- **Secret Protection**: Secure handling of sensitive information
- **Infrastructure Security**: Harden CI/CD infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Meet security standards and regulations

### Security Principles
1. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security assessment
5. **Incident Response**: Rapid threat response and recovery

## 🔐 Threat Model

### Asset Classification

#### Critical Assets
- **Source Code**: Application logic and intellectual property
- **Secrets**: API keys, certificates, database credentials
- **Build Artifacts**: Compiled applications and deployables
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD systems, runners, deployment targets

#### Threat Actors
- **External Attackers**: Malicious actors seeking to compromise systems
- **Insider Threats**: Malicious or compromised internal users
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or tools
- **Automated Attacks**: Bots and automated exploitation tools
